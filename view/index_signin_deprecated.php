        <h4><strong>YouTube Authentication Deprecated</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Due to recent changes in YouTube's authentication policies, OAuth login is no longer supported for downloading videos via this application.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are currently working to restore the YouTube download feature and will provide a solution as soon as one is available.
